# GAN-Game

This project explores the intersection of Game Theory and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), implemented in the repository {https://github.com/SandeepChatterjee66/GAN-Game}. The repository provides code and experiments that illustrate how GANs can be framed as a game-theoretic problem, and training can be modelled as Nash Equilibria finding simple algorithm, where a generator and a discriminator engage in a competitive process. The objective is to analyze how game-theory principles, such as Nash equilibrium, can enhance the training dynamics of GANs and ensure the alignment between the generator's and discriminator's strategies. This approach can offer new insights into improving the training stability and effectiveness of GAN models.
